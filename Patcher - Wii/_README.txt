This is a simple IOS31 patcher. It downloads IOS31 from the NUS (Nintendo Update Servers) and then extracts it, and downloads a copy of the edited APP file containing the RSA key.
It then copies this file in, and packs the new WAD, and deletes all unneeded files.
Windows requires no dependencies, Linux/Mac requires mono - Sharpii will need to download it's DLL weirdly, just hit Y.
